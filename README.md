API/Portal side obligatory steps:
=================================

- First step is to create an External Evaluation project(using either the ACCEPT Portal instance or the ACCEPT API) and upload some data(either from the ACCEPT Portal instance or the ACCEPT API) using the following json format:

```json
{
    "chunkList": [
        {
            "chunk": "I am MT content to evaluate.",
            "chunkInfo": "",
            "active": 1
        },
        {
            "chunk": "I am also MT content to evaluate.",
            "chunkInfo": "",
            "active": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

- The second and last step is to create a proper Question and respective response options. The ID generated by the question creation is then used to set up the client and properly generate the dynamic Web Form. 

Note: On the JSON format, the "ChunkInfo" attribute is not being used at the moment. The attribute "active" needs to be uploaded with the value set to "1" so that the client side(jQuery plug-in) can displayed for evaluation.

Client side configuration:
==========================

acceptApiUrl - The URL for the ACCEPT API instance(for example http://www.accept-portal.com/AcceptApi).
evaluationApiKey - Evaluation API key generated when the Evaluation project is created.
projectId - The ID of the Evaluation project.
questionId - The ID of the Question created under the Evaluation project.
evaluationLanguage - Language in which the question was created.
